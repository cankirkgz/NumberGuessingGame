  <h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>

  <p>This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The program randomly selects a number between 0 and 100, and the user has to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback to the user, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>To run the program, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. Follow these steps:</p>

 <ol>
   <li>Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:<br>
      <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-guessing-game.git</code></li>
    
   <li>Navigate to the project directory:<br>
      <code>cd number-guessing-game</code></li>
    
   <li>Compile the Java source file:<br>
      <code>javac SayiTahminOyunu.java</code></li>
    
  <li>Run the program:<br>
      <code>java SayiTahminOyunu</code></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How to Play</h2>

 <ol>
   <li>The program will prompt you to guess a number between 0 and 100.</li>
    
  <li>Enter your guess and press Enter.</li>
    
   <li>The program will provide feedback, indicating whether your guess is too high or too low.</li>
    
   <li>Continue guessing until you guess the correct number.</li>
    
  <li>Once you guess the correct number, the program will display a congratulatory message along with the number of tries it took.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here's an example of how the program looks and behaves when running:</p>

  <pre>
  Guess a number between 0 and 100.
  Your guess: 50
  Guess a higher number.
  Your guess: 75
  Guess a lower number.
  Your guess: 60
  Congratulations! You guessed 60 correctly in 3 tries.
  </pre>
